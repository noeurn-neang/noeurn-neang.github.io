    <h1>Privacy Policy for Neang Noeurn's n8n Projects</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: October 25, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>Welcome to the privacy policy for my automation projects built with n8n, developed by Neang Noeurn. This policy outlines how data is handled when my n8n workflows interact with Google APIs or other services to automate tasks, such as trend monitoring, data analysis, or other functionalities.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>My n8n workflows, including projects like Trend Watcher and others, are designed to automate tasks using APIs, such as Google APIs (e.g., Google Trends, Google Sheets). These workflows typically collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anonymized, non-personal data</strong>: Aggregated data from APIs (e.g., trend statistics, public datasets).</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration data</strong>: Settings or inputs provided to the n8n workflow to perform its tasks (e.g., search terms, API keys).</li>
        <li><strong>No personal user data</strong>: Unless explicitly designed for a specific project, my workflows do not collect, store, or process personal information from end users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a project requires personal data (e.g., for authenticated API access), this will be clearly disclosed in the project’s documentation.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Data accessed by my n8n workflows is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Execute automation tasks (e.g., fetching trends, processing data, generating reports).</li>
        <li>Deliver outputs to configured destinations (e.g., email, Slack, databases).</li>
        <li>Improve workflow functionality and debug issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data processing occurs within the n8n platform or connected services as specified by the workflow’s design.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any data accessed via Google APIs or other services with third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As required to comply with applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>With service providers (e.g., n8n cloud, API providers) necessary for the workflow’s operation, under strict compliance with their terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Data remains confined to the scope of each project’s n8n workflow and is not transferred beyond its intended use.</p>

    <h2>4. Google API Compliance</h2>
    <p>Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. We ensure all API interactions are secure and compliant with Google’s terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable measures to secure n8n workflows, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure API authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys).</li>
        <li>Encrypted connections for data transfers.</li>
        <li>Regular updates to workflows to address security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since most workflows handle non-personal data, the risk of data breaches is minimal. If personal data is used, additional safeguards will be applied and disclosed.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our projects, APIs, or legal requirements. The latest version will always be available at <a href="https://yourusername.github.io/privacy.html">this URL</a>.</p>
