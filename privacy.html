  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date: October 27, 2025</strong></p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Noeurn Neang ("I," "me," or "my") collects, uses, and protects data in connection with my automation workflows and applications, including those built with n8n and integrating with the Google Sheets API.</p>

  <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
  <p>My applications, such as automation workflows built with n8n (e.g., n8n Trend Watcher), may access the following data when you grant permission via Google OAuth:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets Data</strong>: Specific spreadsheets you authorize for read/write access, used solely for automation tasks (e.g., data processing, trend analysis).</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Account Information</strong>: Your Google account email and profile details to authenticate and link API requests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I do not collect or store any personal data beyond what is necessary for the functionality of the application.</p>

  <h2>2. How I Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>The data accessed is used exclusively to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform automation tasks as configured in n8n workflows (e.g., reading or updating Google Sheets for data analysis).</li>
    <li>Authenticate your identity via Google OAuth to ensure secure access.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Data is processed in real-time and is not stored on my servers or shared with third parties, except as required by Google APIs to fulfill the service.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    - No personal data is stored on my servers or databases.<br>
    - Temporary data processed by n8n (e.g., during workflow execution) is handled securely and deleted after use.<br>
    - I use industry-standard security measures, including HTTPS for API requests, to protect data during transmission.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>My applications rely on the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sheets API</strong>: To access and manage spreadsheet data you authorize.</li>
    <li><strong>n8n</strong>: To execute automation workflows securely.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services have their own privacy policies, which you can review at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li>n8n: <a href="https://n8n.io/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">n8n Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Revoke access to your Google Sheets data at any time via your Google Account settings.</li>
    <li>Request information about how your data is used by contacting me (see below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Contact Information</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or data usage, please contact me:</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
